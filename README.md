## Installation

### Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sankalpbisan/WebScarping_Project.git
cd WebScarping_Project
```

### Setting Up

**Set path**: Change the path as per your need

**Run the Scraper**: To run the scraper, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python WebScraping_Code.py
   ```

**Check the Output**: The scraped data will be saved in the output directory in the format you’ve chosen (CSV, text etc.).

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Data**: The script sends HTTP requests to the target websites.
2. **Parsing HTML**: BeautifulSoup parses the raw HTML content and identifies relevant elements (e.g., titles, salary, etc.).
4. **Storing Data**: Finally, the data is saved in a specified format such as CSV or Text for later analysis or usage.

## Usage Example

Here’s an example of how to scrape product prices from an e-commerce site:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://example.com/job-finder-page'

response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

desc = soup.find('span', class_='job_desc').text
print(f"The job description is: {desc}")
```

This is just a basic example. Depending on the website structure, you can customize the scrapers as needed.
